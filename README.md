# Spring Boot and Gradle
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/drodbar/springboot-gradle.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/drodbar/springboot-gradle)


This is just a demo project to test gradle as a build tool for Java and more concretely Spring Boot. 

After having some problems using [Spring Initilizr](https://start.spring.io/), specifically when a
Spring Boot 1.5.19.RELEASE was set up, I decided to back of and rework it on my own.


## Ingredients

This project uses:
* Spring Boot 1.4.7.RELEASE
* Gradle 5.1.1


##Trying it

You can run the project using gradle via:

    ./gradlew bootRun
